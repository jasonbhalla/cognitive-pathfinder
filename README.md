# cognitive-pathfinder
A multimodal routing engine providing a personalized pathfinding algorithm based on subjective, user-specific costs. It fuses static data with real-time transit and traffic APIs to build a dynamic, weighted graph. The system finds the optimal route that minimizes a user's perceived frustration rather than just the raw travel time.
